What is "Pissotta"?
Pissotta is an ancient Venetian game, which roughly reminds of the well known Bingo - with some exceptions.
The main difference is that the game is based more on images than numbers - so when you extract a number you name also the image associated.

So, if there will be a software based "Pissotta", you could hear a voice calling "Number 21 - the Linux Penguin"

This is a simple program, and thus it works pretty well for the need.
Is command line based, with a pretty self explained command line help.

You can choose 
 - the number of images per board (Pissotta is 4x2, but you can play as you want)
 - a folder which contains images of any size(which can be big as you want - but on Pissotta is just 64)
 - the number of boards you need 

and voilà, you get a perfectly sized pdf ready for printing; it takes care of everything for you: resize images, generate random sequence, make sure no duplicates are generated, assemble them together ad so on.

I made it for my Italian Scout group which was celebrating 70° anniversary, so there is included the library we used based on some public domain scout-based images.

This is for everyone who (may one day) need to generate thousands of "pissotta" (or maybe Bingo) with images for some kind of party or fundraising event
